## What is this package?
This is just to bring back the basic auth login flow Laravel had before 5.1. I don't claim ownership of the controller's code or the views. Even if I tweaked it it was originally released by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell)

I mearly got sick of having to re-type it since the views are now gone.
